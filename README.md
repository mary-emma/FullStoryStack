FullStoryStack is a book tracker application that allows users to track books read and the amount of days each book took to read, receive updated statistics on their reading habits, and view books and reviews submitted by other users. The application was created with Java using Java Swing for the user interface and PHP and SQL for the database.

Reading is a hobby of mine and I enjoy seeing my progress over time, but I've never been able to find a book tracker application that didn't feel overly time consuming or complicated. The goal of the FullStoryStack project was to create a straightforward book tracking application that still had social components and extra features like the statistics page.

My next goal for this project is to add a hash to the passwords stored in the database. As a Computer Science major with a specialization in Computer and Internet Security, I know that plain-text passwords are a very insecure storage method, so this is a change that would need to be done before releasing FullStoryStack publicly.

Other next steps for the project include improving the user interface and potentially adding more information to the home screen, adding more statistics for users to view, and allowing users to leave comments on books and reviews posted by other users.
